In this project, I utilized SQL to extract and analyze data from the Chinook database, focusing on various aspects of the dataset, including track information, 
artist details, customer demographics, sales performance, and employee roles. The queries were designed to address specific business questions and provide 
actionable insights.


#1 Show a list of all the metal tracks and their artists' names.

SELECT t.name, art.name
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
JOIN chinook.genres AS g
ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
JOIN chinook.albums AS alb
ON t.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists AS art
ON alb.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
WHERE g.name = 'Metal'
ORDER BY t.name;


#2 Show all the albums by AC/DC.

SELECT alb.Title AS 'Album Title', art.Name AS 'Artist'
FROM chinook.albums AS alb
JOIN chinook.artists AS art
ON alb.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
WHERE artist = 'AC/DC';


#3 Show customers (their full names, customer ids, and country) who are not in the U.S.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'US';


#4 Show only customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';


#5 Find the invoices of people who are from Brazil. The resulting table should include the customers’ full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers AS c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON c.CustomerId = i. CustomerId
WHERE c.country = 'Brazil';


#6 Show the employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, EmployeeId, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE 'Sales Support Agent';


#7 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice Table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry ASC;


#8 Provide a query that shows the incoives associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent’s full name.

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, i.invoiceId
FROM chinook.employees AS e
INNER JOIN chinook.customers AS c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;


#9 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, c.LastName, c.FirstName, c.Country, i.Total
FROM chinook.customers AS c

ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;


#10 How many invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-001' AND '2009-12-31';


#11 What were the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


#12 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS i
ON t.TrackId = i.TrackId;


#13 Write a query that includes the purchased track name and artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name AS Track, art.Name AS Artist, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
INNER JOIN chinook.albums AS alb
ON t.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists AS art
ON alb.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS i
ON t.TrackId = i.TrackId;


#14 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', mt.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'

LEFT JOIN chinook.albums AS a
ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.media_types AS mt
ON t.MediaTypeId = mt.MediaTypeId
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres AS g
ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId;


#15 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees AS e
INNER JOIN chinook.customers AS c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.LastName;


#16 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'

JOIN chinook.customers AS c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY e.LastName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2)  DESC
LIMIT 1;
