# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in ti to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderId) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT acctnum), ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
