GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT acctnum), ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2
